For this and other information about the Dimensional funds,  please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

"This report and the information contained herein are subject to the terms of the End User License Agreement for Returns Program.",
"Selection of funds, indices and time periods presented chosen by advisor.",
"Performance for periods greater than one year are annualized unless specified otherwise. Selection of funds, indices and time periods presented chosen by advisor. Indices are not available for direct investment and performance does not reflect expenses of an actual portfolio.",
"Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain Dimensional Fund performance data current to the most recent month-end access our website at us.dimensional.com. Average annual total returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Mutual funds distributed by DFA Securities LLC.",
"Model Constructions
Model portfolios are constructed in the Returns Program using past data of funds or indices as of a specific date, assigning weights to those funds or indices to equal 100%. The model portfolios constructed are hypothetical and are not representative of actual portfolios. Their performance is hypothetical, for illustrative purposes only and is subject to limitations. Unless otherwise specified by the user, the hypothetical performance is gross of fees and is rebalanced monthly. The performance presented does not replace an advisor's actual model portfolio performance. Past and hypothetical results are no guarantee of future results. The model performance is based on model/back tested asset allocations. The performance was achieved with the retroactive application of a model designed with the benefit of hindsight; it does not represent actual investment performance. Back-tested model performance is hypothetical (does not reflect trading in actual portfolios) and may not reflect the impact that economic and market factors may have had on advisor's decision-making if the advisor were actually managing client money. Material is not to be considered a recommendation or investment advice to buy or sell any security. 
Dimensional Wealth Models
Performance shown is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. The performance is based on model asset allocations using actual, historical underlying fund data and is based on net asset value returns for underlying mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The performance was achieved with the retroactive application of a model designed with the benefit of hindsight; it does not represent actual investment performance and it does not take into account any individual investor circumstances. Hypothetical model performance does note reflect trading in actual portfolios and may not reflect the impact that economic and market factors may have had on decision-making if managing actual client money. Actual performance of any fund or strategy may vary significantly from the hypothetical performance presented due to assumptions regarding fees, transactions costs, liquidity or other market factors. Actual historical allocations could have differed, perhaps significantly. Advisory fees paid to underlying component funds are reflected in the performance results. Advisory fees to a financial advisor, custodian fees, trading costs and transaction costs that may be applicable in the management of an overall portfolio are not reflected.
Hypothetical performance for Dimensional Wealth Models reflects changes in the underlying fund allocations, if any, since the model's inception. Performance results prior to the Dimensional Model's inception are computed using the inception fund weights and component fund performance back to the inception of the youngest component fund. The Dimensional Models do not include an allocation to cash or cash equivalents, except indirectly through a Dimensional Fund.
Results presented are no guarantee of future results and may vary. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate and may be worth more or less than the original investment.
Dimensional Indices
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Actual returns may be lower. The Dimensional Indices represent academic concepts that may be used in portfolio construction and are not available for the investment or for use as a benchmark. Index returns are not representative of actual portfolio returns and do not reflect costs and fees associated with an actual investment. See "Index Descripition" for descriptions of the Dimensional Index data.These indices have been retrospectively calculated by Dimensional Fund Advisors LP and did not exist prior to their index inceptions dates. Accordingly, results shown during the periods prior to each index's index inception date do not represent actual returns of the index.
Exchange-Traded Funds
ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade either at a premium or discount to their net asset value. ETF shares trade at market price and are not individually redeemable with the issuing fund, other than in large share amounts called creation units. ETFs are subject to risk similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short-selling and margin account maintenance. Brokerage commissions and expenses will reduce returns.",
"Principal Risks    
The principal risks of investing in the Dimensional funds may include one or more of the following: market risk, small companies risk, risk of concentrating in the real estate industry, foreign securities and currencies risk, emerging markets risk, banking concentration risk, foreign government debt risk, interest rate risk, risk of investing for inflation protection, credit risk, risk of municipal securities, derivatives risk, securities lending risk call risk, liquidity risk, income risk, value investment risk, investment strategy risk, and/or fund of funds risk. To more fully understand the risks related to an investment in the funds, investors should carefully read each fund's prospectus. Investments in foreign issuers are subject to certain considerations that are not associated with investments in US public companies. Investments of the International Equity, Emerging Markets Equity and the Global Fixed Income Portfolios will be denominated in foreign currencies.  Changes in the relative values of these foreign currencies and the US dollar, therefore, will affect the value of investments in the Portfolios.  However, the Global Fixed Income Portfolios may utilize forward currency contracts to attempt to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency rates (if applicable), to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates or to transfer balances from one currency to another. Foreign securities prices may decline or fluctuate because of: (a) economic or political actions of foreign governments, and/or (b) less regulated or liquid securities markets.",
